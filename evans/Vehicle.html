      <h>Transport Cleaning</h>

      <p>After long journeys your chosen vehicle of transport can be left looking unclean and unloved. Here at T&M Cleaning we use our own specialised cleaning formulas to leave your vehicle looking sparklingly new. We cover all areas such as bodywork, windows, all exterior parts and Rims. </p>
<h>Our experience</h>
<p>The services we deliver in these areas have been varied, ranging from the cleaning of stations, depots, and park and ride sites to the actual passenger vehicles. An area where we have developed particularly specialist expertise is working within the cleaning and the maintenance of on-street infrastructure where we work extensively currently managing a fleet of vehicles which deliver the cleaning services to over 12,000 bus stops and over 7,000 shelters across 8 conurbations. In addition the services we deliver include the management of timetable information cases and the change over and posting of crucial information at structured times for exchange each year.</p>
